# Job Candidature 

The project is a web application built with React.js. It retrieves job listings from an API and allows users to filter and search through these listings based on various criteria such as role, experience, location, and tech stack. Users can view detailed information about each job listing in a modal window. Additionally, the application features infinite scrolling for seamless browsing of job listings and a "scroll to top" button for user convenience. Overall, the project aims to provide an intuitive and user-friendly interface for exploring and applying to job opportunities.
